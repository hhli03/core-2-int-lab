description: I designed a website that collects my 30 favorite childhood snacks from Hong Kong. The website is not only a showcase of my favorite snacks but also a personal archive of my memories. Viewers should experience a sense of nostalgia through the design and layout, including the color palette and hand-drawn illustrations.
