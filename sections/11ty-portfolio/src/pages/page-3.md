description: I designed a website based on the short story "The Year of Spaghetti" by Haruki Murakami. The story follows a person who cooks spaghetti daily for a year, finding meaning and distraction from personal struggles through this obsession. The website consists of 5 pages, each with a unique layout and composition that corresponds to the content of the respective chapter. Through typography and interactive elements, I aimed to immerse viewers in the main character's perspective and thoughts.
