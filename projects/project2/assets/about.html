            This website is a collection of my 30 favorite childhood snacks from Hong Kong. Growing up, these snacks held a special place in my heart, and even today, I still crave them whenever I'm away from home. Each snack is a personal favorite that carries a unique story and nostalgic memory.

This website is not only a showcase of my favorite snacks but also a personal archive of my memories. I hope visitors can experience a sense of nostalgia through the design and layout, including the color palette and hand-drawn illustrations. Every snack comes with an anecdote, which adds a personal touch to the website.

Whether you're a local looking to reminisce about your childhood or a curious traveler wanting to explore Hong Kong's unique snacks, this website is the perfect resource.
