When the phone rang at 3:20 p.m. I was sprawled out on the tatami, staring at the ceiling. A pool of winter sunlight had formed in the place where I lay. Like a dead fly I lay there, vacant, in a December spotlight.
<br>
<br>
At first, I didn’t recognize the sound as the phone ringing. It was more like an unfamiliar memory that had hesitantly slipped in between the layers of air. Finally, though, it began to take shape, and, in the end, a ringing phone was unmistakably what it was. It was one hundred per cent a phone ring in one-hundred-per-cent real air. Still sprawled out, I reached over and picked up the receiver.
<br>
<br>
On the other end was a girl, a girl so indistinct that, by four-thirty, she might very well have disappeared altogether. She was the ex-girlfriend of a friend of mine. Something had brought them together, this guy and this indistinct girl, and something had led them to break up. I had, I admit, reluctantly played a role in getting them together in the first place.
<br>
<br>
<span id="white">“Sorry to bother you,” she said, “but do you know where he is now?”</span>
<br>
<br>
I looked at the phone, running my eyes along the length of the cord. The cord was, sure enough, attached to the phone. I managed a vague reply. There was something ominous in the girl’s voice, and whatever trouble was brewing I knew that I didn’t want to get involved.
<br>
<br>
<span id="white">“Nobody will tell me where he is,” she said in a chilly tone. “Everybody’s pretending they don’t know. But there’s something important I have to tell him, so please—tell me where he is. I promise I won’t drag you into this. Where is he?”</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="underline">“I honestly don’t know,”</span> I told her. <span class="underline">“I haven’t seen him in a long time.”</span> My voice didn’t sound like my own. I was telling the truth about not having seen him for a long time, but not about the other part—I did know his address and phone number. Whenever I tell a lie, something weird happens to my voice.
<br>
<br>
<span id="highlight1">No comment from her.</span>
<br>
<br>
The phone was like a pillar of ice.
<br>
<br>
Then all the objects around me turned into pillars of ice, as if I were in a J. G. Ballard science-fiction story.
<br>
<br>
<span class="underline">“I really don’t know,”</span> I repeated. <span class="underline">“He went away a long time ago, without saying a word.”</span>
<br>
<br>
<span id="white">The girl laughed. “Give me a break. He’s not that clever. We’re talking about a guy who has to make a lot of noise no matter what he does.”</span>
<br>
<br>
She was right. The guy really was a bit of a dim bulb.
<br>
<br>
But I wasn’t about to tell her where he was. Do that, and next I’d have him on the phone, giving me an earful. I was through with getting caught up in other people’s messes. I’d already dug a hole in the back yard and buried everything that needed to be buried in it. Nobody could ever dig it up again.
<br>
<br>
<span class="underline">“I’m sorry,”</span> I said.
<br>
<br>
<span id="white">“You don’t like me, do you?” she said suddenly.</span>
<br>
<br>
I had no idea what to say. I didn’t particularly dislike her. I had no real impression of her at all. It’s hard to have a bad impression of somebody you have no impression of.
<br>
<br>
<span class="underline">“I’m sorry,”</span> I said again. <span class="underline">“But I’m cooking spaghetti right now.”</span>
<br>
<br>
<span id="white">“I’m sorry?”</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="underline">“I said I’m cooking spaghetti,”</span> I lied. I had no idea why I said that. But the lie had already become a part of me—so much so that, at that moment at least, it didn’t feel like a lie at all.
<br>
<br>
I went ahead and filled an imaginary pot with imaginary water, lit an imaginary stove with an imaginary match.
<br>
<br>
<span id="white">“So?” she asked.</span>
<br>
<br>
I sprinkled imaginary salt into the boiling water, gently lowered a handful of imaginary spaghetti into the imaginary pot, set the imaginary kitchen timer for eight minutes.
<br>
<br>
<span class="underline">“So I can’t talk. The spaghetti will be ruined.”</span>
<br>
<br>
<span id="highlight2">She didn’t say anything.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="underline">“I’m really sorry, but cooking spaghetti is a delicate operation.”</span>
<br>
<br>
<span id="highlight3">The girl was silent.</span>
<br>
<br>
The phone in my hand began to freeze again.
<br>
<br>
<span class="underline">“So could you call me back?”</span> I added hurriedly.
<br>
<br>
<span id="white">“Because you’re in the middle of making spaghetti?” she asked.</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="underline">“Yeah.”</span>
<br>
<br>
<span id="white">“Are you making it for someone, or are you going to eat alone?”</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="underline">“I’ll eat it by myself,”</span> I said.
<br>
<br>
<span id="white">She held her breath for a long time, then slowly breathed out. “There’s no way you could know this, but I’m really in trouble. I don’t know what to do.”</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="underline">“I’m sorry I can’t help you,”</span> I said.
<br>
<br>
<span id="white">“There’s some money involved, too.”</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="underline">“I see.”</span>
<br>
<br>
<span id="white">“He owes me money,” she said. “I lent him some money. I shouldn’t have, but I had to.”</span>
<br>
<br>
I was quiet for a minute, my thoughts drifting toward spaghetti. <span class="underline">“I’m sorry,”</span> I said. <span class="underline">“But I’ve got the spaghetti going, so . . .”</span>
<br>
<br>
<span id="white">She gave a listless laugh. “Goodbye,” she said. “Say hi to your spaghetti for me. I hope it turns out O.K.”</span>
<br>
<br>
<span class="underline">“Bye,”</span> I said.
<br>
<br>
When I hung up the phone, the circle of light on the floor had shifted an inch or two. I lay down again in that pool of light and resumed staring at the ceiling.
