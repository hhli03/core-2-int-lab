Spring, summer, and fall, I cooked and cooked, as if cooking <span class="spaghettiwhite1">spaghetti</span> were an act of revenge. Like a lonely, jilted girl throwing old love letters into the fireplace, I tossed one handful of <span class="spaghettiwhite2">spaghetti</span> after another into the pot.
<br>
<br>
I’d gather up the trampled-down shadows of time, knead them into the shape of a German shepherd, toss them into the roiling water, and sprinkle them with salt. Then I’d hover over the pot, oversized chopsticks in hand, until the timer dinged its plaintive note.
<br>
<br>
<span class="spaghettiwhite3">Spaghetti</span> strands are a crafty bunch, and I couldn’t let them out of my sight. If I were to turn my back, they might well slip over the edge of the pot and vanish into the night. The night lay in silent ambush, hoping to waylay the prodigal strands.

<br>
<br>
Born in heat, the strands of <span class="spaghettiwhite11">spaghetti</span> washed down the river of 1971 and vanished.
<br>
<br>
I mourn them all—all the <span class="spaghettiwhite12">spaghetti</span> of the year 1971.
