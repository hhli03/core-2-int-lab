            In this week’s lecture, Elaine talks about the topic of how decolonization is not a metaphor for the change needed in the design industry. She raises an interesting question about which parts of design we can remove without alienating other people in the process. I think that it’s always been hard to accept the diverse culture in the design field, as Elaine said, the industry still has a lot of work to do. It’s very hard to see inclusivity in today’s world, especially since design is a field that’s predominantly white. Therefore, Elaine initiates that we should "colonize" design, add our culture to design, and build upon it.

            Culture and identity are something unique and special to each individual; hence, I agree with Elaine that everyone should make work about their own culture and identity. We should use design as a tool to learn about our cultures and even share them. The merging of cultures and ideas helps you connect with your work the easiest, and it can create something that’s personal to you.

            Elaine’s work explores the intersection of culture, identity, equity, and risograph printing. Through the projects that she did, I can see how she is trying to share stories that have been neglected for a long time. Domiknows is a project that was inspired by her Cuban culture. I like how she talked about the cultural background of dominos to let the audience see and learn where dominos are actually from and what they are. The idea that this is an installation that everyone can have the opportunity to take part in makes the project very special; it becomes an engaging and collaborative experience. Not only does this project bring people together to learn about her Cuban culture, but it’s also a memorable experience.

            This lecture was very insightful, and it made me rethink my identity and culture. Sometimes we may feel like our cultural identity is not a strength, but Elaine’s lecture and work made me want to reconnect with my culture and explore more about my culture through design. I totally agree with Elaine that we should celebrate our identities. I think that we can all expand design by including everyone’s voices and culures.
