    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">"A Vernacular Web"</span> by <span class="author">Olia Lialina</span></h2>

        The web of the mid-90s has a very rich culture that always seems to be overlooked. Some may think that this sort of old-fashioned behavior is no longer needed and that we should just focus on the current style and trends in web design. Though I agree that the amateur web is part of the past, it is still something that has a powerful past. It is important for people to remember the roots of the internet, so I agree with Lialina that there’s a need to preserve and archive these web expressions. People always see these signs and symbols of the early web as negative examples. Sometimes I do think that these elements make the website look very outdated and jarring, but it all depends on how you use them in your project and what’s the intention of using them. There should always be a purpose for using these elements; we shouldn’t use them simply to be trendy or because everyone else is using them.
<br>
<br>
Personally, I believe that the starry night background will still look great on the web today as long as it is paired with a good typeface and as long as it fits well with the content. I remember how they were frequently used as wallpapers or backgrounds in the past. I truly believe that using a starry night background is a great way to set the tone of the website, giving it a futuristic and magical feel. On the other hand, web graphics remind me of the early days of the internet. I love the vibrant colors and the animated gifs. They are very expressive and add a lot of character to the website. It’s a great way to make something dull look more interesting and unique. I believe the "Welcome to my home page" page has already been labeled as an amateur page. I don’t think it’s necessary to include it on your page because it might give the impression that the quality of your site is poor. However, it’s never inappropriate to include it. There are times when it works well; I believe that it depends on the audience and how you want them to react to or receive this information. It can sometimes be a pleasant surprise because it’s not something we would expect to see on a website nowadays because it’s considered outdated.
<br>
<br>
The world web is constantly evolving and changing; there will always be new elements, graphics, and designs, so I think it’s critical to find what works for you and your project. There’s a difference between using something correctly and just using it for no particular reason. It is never wrong to use these elements if they express your idea well. Rather than using these amateur elements in a traditional manner, perhaps, you can use them in an innovative way to create something more unique and creative. As Lialina mentioned, "There was a world of options, and one of the options was to be different." I think we should all try to be different, even though it’s risky. We shouldn’t be afraid to use elements and designs just because they are commonly perceived as "bad" or "old." Reading this brought back a lot of nostalgic memories of the web from the past. I don’t think any of these elements will be forgotten, as they had such a large impact on the internet.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">"My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?"</span> by <span class="author">Laurel Schwulst</span></h2>
    <p>
        <div class="time">[01/25/2023] [2:17 p.m.]</div>
        <br>
        Schwulst uses different metaphors to explain what a website can be and the possibilities that a website can have. I think a website is something hard to define because there are endless possibilities as to what a website could be. Websites are important, especially for artists, because they allow them to create their world. not only creating the objects inside the world but also the surroundings, for example, the language, style, rules, and architecture. The artist has all the control and can create anything they want, which I think is amazing and such a useful tool when you want to build something that forms your identity.
        <br>
        <br>
        Among the metaphors that Schwulst used to describe a website, I think describing a website as a shelf stood out to me. It makes me think of what I tend to put on a shelf. It’s usually something that I want to present to others, something that I like and enjoy, and something that represents me. Besides, shelves shouldn’t be too cramped with too many things. I guess that’s the same when thinking about what to include on your website. As Schwulst said, a website should include small and light things, just like what we place on a shelf. Moreover, I also like the metaphor of a puddle, because I agree that "There is also no state of "completeness" to a website, like a puddle," as Schwulst said. There’s no such thing as a finished or unfinished website; it’s an endless space for you to create and build. Just like puddles, websites can be big or small. Sometimes the website is relevant, but sometimes it just disappears and people forget about it. It’s the same as puddles; they only appear after a rain or storm, and the water evaporates slowly over time. I think this is an honest representation of what a website is and how people may react to it; it won’t always be seen, and there are a lot of aspects that you can’t take control of as well.
        <br>
        <br>
        Overall, I enjoyed the reading. It’s very poetic and imaginative. I’ve never seen people use metaphors to explain or describe websites at all. The addition of the sparrows and quotes is informative and entertaining at the same time; they gave me a break from the reading and taught me facts about websites. I think using metaphors makes this piece memorable; it helped me picture what a website is like easily, perhaps because I’m more of a visual learner. Furthermore, by employing metaphors, we can recall our collective responsibility for creating a better web. Websites should not be solely focused on social media and commercialization. We as artists and designers should think expansively about what a website can be. We should have greater ambitions for the web. After all, websites should "reflect our hopes and fulfill our dreams, rather than magnify our fears and deepen our divisions," as the creator of the World Wide Web, Berners Lee said.

        This article by Loretta Staples provides an interesting and insightful look into the history of digital typography from 1984-1997. It is a thorough and detailed exploration of the various technological advances and developments in this field over the 13-year period. I was particularly impressed with how Staples was able to provide a comprehensive overview of the major milestones in digital typography. She provided a very clear and concise explanation of each of the key developments, making it easy to understand the various innovations and their significance, especially with the illustrated diagrams and examples. Staples’ critical analysis of technology made me realize its huge impact on the wider world. Besides, learning about the positive and negative consequences of the developments in digital typography enabled me to gain a well-rounded understanding of the field. I think the part which I find the most interesting is ​the emergence of PostScript and TrueType, which revolutionized the way fonts were used. It’s fascinating to see how the development of font software and typographic standards allowed for greater control and flexibility.
        <br>
        <br>Overall, I found "Typography and the Screen: a Technical Chronology of Digital Typography, 1984-1997" by Loretta Staples to be an informative and engaging article. It provides a comprehensive look into the evolution of digital typography over the years, giving me a better understanding of the technological advances and their implications. I think that this article serves as an important reminder of the importance of typography in the digital world, and how it has been shaped by technological advances.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">"The Web’s Grain"</span> by <span class="author">Frank Chimero</span></h2>
    <p>
        <div class="time">[02/09/2023] [01:10 a.m.]</div>
        <br>
        There are always times when we need to search for a different perspective, especially in web design. Some designers tend to just follow the traditional way, while some sites try to be different. I think that’s when it’s time for us to all step back and think about the bigger picture. Chimero mentioned how we should stop treating the web like a blank canvas to paint on and instead treat it like a material to build with, and I definitely agree that we should think of the web as a creative tool. We should think in a larger and broader way, thinking about how we can actually work against the web’s natural character.
<br>
<br>
Chimero showed Hockney’s photography work as an example of working with space in an unconventional way, which really inspired me and opened my mind about how things don’t always have to be inside a fixed size or in a frame. Sometimes, we should just abandon these typical ways and rules of working, and we may be able to create something more unique in an endless and edgeless space. Seeing Hockney’s individual photos overlaid and assembled was fascinating; it’s like a freeform collage, creating these multiplied faces, repetitive images, and uneven edges, almost like a maze or mosaic.
<br>
<br>
I agree with Chimero that we should not be restricted by the limited spaces, instead, we should think that we are working on an edgeless surface, and there can be unknown proportions comprised of different elements. There are so many possibilities in web design, so we should challenge what we already know and can do. I think the assemblage of elements, layout, placements, and the appropriate use of space all play a huge role in web design. And they’re definitely something that we should explore more.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">"Black Gooey Universe"</span> by <span class="author">American Artist</span></h2>
    <p>
        <div class="time">[02/15/2023] [10:52 p.m.]</div>
        <br>
        In "Black Gooey Universe", American Artist directly addresses the development of the graphical user interface (GUI), its implications on race relations, and how it is a reflection of the anti-Blackness in the tech field. They mention that the GUI was developed in Silicon Valley by white male engineers and that this ultimately reflects white ideology in the tech industry. This made me realize how the development of the GUI in Silicon Valley has obscured the complex technology and history behind it, making it difficult for people of color to gain a foothold in the tech industry. American Artist goes on to explain how the 1970s transition from black to white screens, such as the Apple Lisa, is a metaphor for the theft and erasure of blackness. American Artist was able to demonstrate how the industry remains predominantly white and how developers have lost touch with the interests of their users. Nowadays, many devices are still built on the basis of white space and continue to be seen as neutral. It is easy to overlook the fact that these market-driven products are still anti-black and echo the same white ideals, especially in the space of high technology.

    <h2>Response to: <span class="title">"Function as Narrative"</span> by <span class="author">Weiyi Li</span></h2>
    <p>
        <div class="time">[02/21/2023] [03:28 p.m.]</div>
        <br>
        In "Function as Narrative", Li explores the idea that function and narrative are closely connected in design. She argues that the narrative element of design, such as the message or story that a product conveys through its form and function, is just as important as its functionality in creating an effective and meaningful design.
        <br>
        <br>
Li illustrates her argument by creating several products and objects, such as a medicine container, a template for female body parts, and a container for a broken mirror. The container for the broken mirror, ‘To make up’ stood out to me from the first series as it made me realize how specific forms of man-made products can become symbols of the system and a language that we can read, allowing us to understand and respond to them intuitively. In this case, the finger hole serves as a form of language that allows people to know how to take out and put together the mirror fragments, fixing something that has been broken. 
<br>
<br>
Li’s second series involves collecting objects that can be used for completely different functions and developing narratives relative to them. I think that this concept is a great way to challenge the original function of the objects and prompt the viewer to consider what other functions they could serve. The stamps and rings have unusual designs but still, adhere to the basic standards of a stamp with a flat surface and a handle and a ring with decoration and finger encasement. By collecting these objects that are not meant to be used as stamps and rings, Li is able to create a narrative and challenge the formal language typically associated with them. By trying to misunderstand their formal language and using them in new ways, Li creates a new narrative for these objects and gives them a new purpose.
<br>
<br>
Overall, I agree with Li that by prioritizing the narrative element alongside functionality, designers can create more compelling and memorable designs that resonate with their audience. However, while incorporating a narrative can be a powerful way to create more meaningful and impactful designs, it's not always necessary or appropriate for every design. Designers must carefully consider the context and intended use of the product, as well as the target audience and desired emotional response, in order to determine whether narrative elements are appropriate and effective for the design.
